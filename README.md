Each time you are going to commit code, you must follow the rules:

* Is your code related to charts, prediction or csv generating? Please commit your code to the right folder!
* CREATE A SUBFOLDER. Be descriptive in your naming so other mates can know what is inside.
* Once you have created the folder, put a Readme.md file describing AT LEAST what is in the folder. An example could be "WWTP flow comparison per regions. Jupiter notebook can be found in the folder XXX and plots generated in folder XXX. 
* Specify in the readme file who did the commit (or if you are modifiying other mate's work, put also your name and changes in order to track the changes).
* Also, please comment your code/notebook and try to maintain it clean


### If your commit does not fit into the schema, please create a folder in the root and put a readme file explaining what is inside!!!

[Remember that you can use other notebooks as a template](https://github.com/start-and-solve/DATARESPONSIBLECHALLENGE/blob/master/Image_Related_analysis/day_of_week/Day_of_the_week.ipynb)
